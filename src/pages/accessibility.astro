    <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
    <p>
      This statement describes the current accessibility baseline and
      improvement process. It is a practical implementation note, not a legal
      certification.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This statement covers the public website and pages under the toyb.space
        domain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third-party tools embedded from external vendors may have separate
        accessibility coverage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibility Measures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Semantic HTML structure with landmarks, headings, and readable link
        text.
      </li>
      <li>Keyboard focus visibility and skip-link support for navigation.</li>
      <li>Color choices and contrast-aware styles for improved readability.</li>
      <li>
        Reduced-motion support for users with motion sensitivity preferences.
      </li>
      <li>Automated accessibility checks in CI using axe-core.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you encounter barriers, report them to
      <a href="mailto:accessibility@toyb.space">accessibility@toyb.space</a> with
      page URL, device, browser, and a short description of the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>Compatibility and Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Latest versions of major browsers and assistive technologies are the
        primary target baseline.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some components may require iterative fixes as new content is added.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Review Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      Accessibility checks should run in CI for every change set, with periodic
      manual keyboard and screen-reader verification.
