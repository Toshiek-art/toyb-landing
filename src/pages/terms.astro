    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Operator Information</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
      website located at toyb.space (the "Website") and any related early
      access programs, beta releases, crowdfunding initiatives, and future
      digital services (collectively, the "Services").
    </p>
    <p>
      The Website and Services are currently operated by Aldo Gustavo Malasomma,
      acting as an individual based in Estonia ("we", "us", "our").
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that the Services may, at a later stage, be transferred
      to and operated by a legal entity (including but not limited to an
      Estonian private limited company (osaühing, OÜ)). In such case, these
      Terms shall automatically apply to the successor entity without affecting
      your rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      By accessing or using the Website or Services, you agree to be bound by
      these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Nature of the Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Website currently provides information about a digital worldbuilding
      and creative management platform under development.
    </p>
    <p>The Services may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Informational content</li>
      <li>Early access or waitlist registration</li>
      <li>Participation in crowdfunding campaigns</li>
      <li>Beta testing access</li>
      <li>Future Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Services are evolving and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued
      at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Early Access and Beta Services</h2>
    <p>
      Any early access, preview, or beta versions of the Services are provided
      for evaluation and testing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>You understand and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Features may be incomplete or subject to change</li>

      <li>Data submitted during early stages may not be permanently stored</li>
      <li>No guarantees are made regarding stability or availability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use of early-stage Services is at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>4. Crowdfunding Campaigns</h2>
    <p>
      If the Services include or reference a crowdfunding campaign (including
      but not limited to Kickstarter), such campaign is governed by the terms
      and policies of the respective crowdfunding platform.
    </p>
    <p>By participating in a crowdfunding campaign:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Delivery timelines are estimates and may change</li>
      <li>Rewards are subject to development feasibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We make reasonable efforts to fulfill stated commitments but cannot
      guarantee specific delivery dates.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Content (Future Services)</h2>
    <p>
      In future versions of the Services, users may be able to create, upload,
      or manage content.

      You retain ownership of your intellectual property rights in any content
      you create or upload.
    </p>
    <p>
      You grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, store,
      process, and display such content solely for the purpose of operating and
      improving the Services.
    </p>
    <p>We do not claim ownership over user-created content.</p>
