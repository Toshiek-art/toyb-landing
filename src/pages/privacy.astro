    <p>
      Aldo Gustavo Malasomma<br />
      Kreutzwaldi 22-2<br />
      10147 Tallinn, Estonia<br />
      Email: <a href="mailto:support@toyb.space">support@toyb.space</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The startup is not yet formally incorporated. Therefore, personal data
      are processed directly by the Data Controller as a natural person.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Categories of Personal Data Processed</h2>
    <p>Through the landing page, the following personal data are collected:</p>

      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>
        Consent information (waitlist consent, marketing consent if provided,
        confirmation of age 16+, timestamp of consent)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Pursuant to Article 4 GDPR, personal data means any information relating
      to an identified or identifiable natural person.
    </p>
    <p>The following data are not collected:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Special categories of data (Art. 9 GDPR)</li>
      <li>Data relating specifically to minors</li>
      <li>Profiling data</li>
      <li>Behavioral tracking data</li>
      <li>Analytics or advertising cookies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
    <p>The email address is processed for the following purposes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Registration on the product waitlist</li>
      <li>Early access (beta / early access programs)</li>
      <li>Communications regarding the development status of the project</li>
      <li>
        If explicitly consented to, sending promotional communications and
        newsletters related to the launch of the product, including potential
        crowdfunding campaigns
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Marketing communications are sent only to users who have provided
      separate and explicit consent.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>Processing is based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consent of the data subject (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Separate consent is collected for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waitlist registration</li>
      <li>Marketing communications (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Users must declare that they are at least 16 years old before submitting
      their email address, in accordance with Article 8 GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consent may be withdrawn at any time by contacting{" "}
      <a href="mailto:support@toyb.space">support@toyb.space</a> or by using
      the unsubscribe mechanism included in communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing
      carried out prior to withdrawal.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Nature of Data Provision</h2>
    <p>Providing an email address is voluntary.</p>
    <p>
      Failure to provide it prevents registration to the waitlist and receipt
      of project-related communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing marketing consent is optional and does not affect waitlist
      registration.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Processing Methods and Security Measures</h2>
    <p>
      Data processing is carried out using electronic and telematic tools, in

      to Article 32 GDPR, including:

    <p>
      These providers act as Data Processors pursuant to Article 28 GDPR and
      process personal data solely on behalf of the Data Controller under
      contractual agreements compliant with GDPR requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      No CRM system, advertising pixel, behavioral tracking tool, or automated
      profiling system is used.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Transfers Outside the European Economic Area</h2>

      stated purposes.
